What are data structures, and why are they important ?\n","\n","ans. Data structures are organized ways to store and manage data in a computer, like arrays, linked lists, stacks, or queues. They are important because they help efficiently access, process, and organize data, making programs faster and more effective.\n","\n","2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n","\n","Ans- Mutable Data Types:\n","\n","Can be changed after creation (e.g., elements can be modified, added, or removed).\n","Examples:\n","List: my_list = [1, 2, 3]; my_list[0] = 10 → [10, 2, 3]\n","Dictionary: my_dict = {\"a\": 1}; my_dict[\"a\"] = 2 → {\"a\": 2}\n","Immutable Data Types:\n","\n","Cannot be changed after creation (any modification creates a new object).\n","Examples:\n","Tuple: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3); my_tuple[0] = 10 → Error\n","String: my_str = \"hello\"; my_str += \" world\" → A new string is created \"hello world\"\n","\n","3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python ?\n","\n","Ans- Mutability:\n","\n","Lists: Mutable (can be changed after creation).\n","Tuples: Immutable (cannot be changed after creation).\n","\n","Syntax:\n","\n","Lists: Use square brackets, e.g., [1, 2, 3].\n","Tuples: Use parentheses, e.g., (1, 2, 3).\n","\n","Performance:\n","\n","Lists: Slower as they allow modifications.\n","Tuples: Faster due to immutability.\n","\n","Use Cases:\n","\n","Lists: Used when data needs to change.\n","Tuples: Used for fixed collections of data.\n","\n","4.  Describe how dictionaries store data ?\n","\n","Ans- Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value. Internally, dictionaries use a hash table, where keys are hashed to determine their location in memory. This allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n","\n","5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python ?\n","\n","Ans- You might use a set instead of a list in Python when you need to store unique items and perform fast membership checks, as sets automatically remove duplicates and are optimized for such operations.\n","\n","6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list ?\n","\n","Ans- In Python:\n","\n","String: A sequence of characters (e.g., \"hello\") used for text. Strings are immutable, meaning they can't be changed after creation.\n","\n","List: A collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, \"hello\"]) that can hold different data types. Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed.\n","\n","Key Difference:\n","Strings are for text and cannot be modified, while lists are flexible collections and can be changed.\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python ?\n","\n","Ans- Tuples ensure data integrity in Python because they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after creation. This ensures the data remains consistent and unaltered throughout the program.\n","\n","8.  What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","\n","Ans- A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to map keys to an index in an array, allowing for efficient retrieval of values.\n","\n","In Python, dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, where keys are hashed to quickly find their associated values.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python ?\n","\n","Ans- Yes, lists in Python can contain different data types. For example, a list can hold integers, strings, and other objects together.\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n","\n","Ans- Strings are immutable in Python because they cannot be changed after they are created. This design ensures:\n","\n","**Performance**: Reusing strings instead of modifying them improves efficiency.\n","\n","**Thread Safety**: Immutable objects are safer to use in multi-threaded programs.\n","\n","**Hashing**: Strings can be used as keys in dictionaries because their hash values remain constant.\n","\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n","\n","Ans- Dictionaries offer these advantages over lists:  \n","\n","1. **Fast Lookup**: Accessing values by keys in a dictionary is faster than searching in a list.  \n","2. **Key-Value Pairs**: They store data as key-value pairs, making it easier to associate and retrieve related information.  \n","3. **Uniqueness**: Keys in dictionaries are unique, preventing duplicate entries.  \n","4. **Flexibility**: You can use non-integer keys, unlike lists which are indexed by integers.  \n","\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","\n","Ans- Use a tuple when you need an immutable collection of items, such as storing constant data like coordinates (e.g., `(10, 20)`), or when using it as a key in a dictionary because tuples are hashable, unlike lists.\n","\n","13.  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?\n","\n","Ans- In Python, sets automatically remove duplicate values. If you add duplicate items to a set, only one instance of each value is kept.\n","\n","14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n","\n","Ans- The **`in`** keyword works as follows:\n","\n","- **For lists**: It checks if a value is present in the list.  \n","  Example:  \n","  ```python\n","  3 in [1, 2, 3]  # True\n","  ```\n","\n","- **For dictionaries**: It checks if a key is present in the dictionary (not the values).  \n","  Example:  \n","  ```python\n","  \"a\" in {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}  # True\n","  ```\n","  \n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not ?\n","\n","Ans- No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable in Python. This means their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed after the tuple is created.\n","\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case ?\n","\n","Ans- A **nested dictionary** is a dictionary within another dictionary. It allows hierarchical data storage, similar to a tree structure.\n","\n","### Example Use Case:\n","Storing student details by their IDs:\n","```python\n","students = {\n","    \"101\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 20, \"grade\": \"A\"},\n","    \"102\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 22, \"grade\": \"B\"}\n","}\n","\n","# Accessing data\n","print(students[\"101\"][\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n","```\n","17.  Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary ?\n","\n","Ans- The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is **O(1)** on average because dictionaries use a hash table for storage. However, in the worst case (due to hash collisions), it can be **O(n)**.\n","\n","\n","18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries ?\n","\n","Ans- Lists are preferred over dictionaries when:\n","\n","1. **Order Matters**: Lists maintain the order of elements.\n","2. **Simple Data**: You only need a collection of values, not key-value pairs.\n","3. **Sequential Access**: You primarily access elements by their position (index).\n","4. **Duplicates Allowed**: Lists allow duplicate values.\n","\n","Use lists for storing simple, ordered, or duplicate data without needing unique keys.\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ?\n","\n","Ans- Dictionaries are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order of key-value pairs as inserted. Instead, they organize data based on a hash table for efficient access.\n","\n","This affects data retrieval by ensuring fast lookups based on keys (O(1) time complexity) but means you can't rely on the insertion order unless using an `OrderedDict` (or Python 3.7+, where insertion order is preserved but not guaranteed as a design feature).\n","\n","20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval ?\n","\n","Ans- In a list, data is retrieved by index position (e.g., `list[0]`), whereas in a dictionary, data is retrieved using a unique key (e.g., `dict['key']`). Lists are ordered, while dictionaries are unordered and store data in key-value pairs."],"metadata":{"id":"Jn82eADs2VlE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Practical Questions**"],"metadata":{"id":"vsWe-BBXFUvg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.
